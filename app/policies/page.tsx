              <h2>Environmental Policy</h2>
              <p>
                Trekkers Heaven is committed to sustainable and responsible
                trekking. We follow Leave No Trace principles: pack out all
                waste, minimise campfire impact, respect wildlife, and stay on
                designated trails.
              </p>
              <p>
                We work with local communities to support conservation and
                reduce environmental impact. We encourage participants to carry
                reusable bottles, avoid single-use plastics, and respect flora
                and fauna. We aim to leave the mountains better than we find
                them.
